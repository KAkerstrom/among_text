Todo:
 - use a client-stored uuid to ensure users can reconnect if they lose connection


Must-haves:
  - Check at start if there are enough players
  - Emergency button

  - Tasks
    - Once all tasks are complete, the game ends - show Victory/Defeat

  - Sabotage
    - Lights
      - Hides who is in the room, won't show bodies, won't show when imposter vents or kills
      - Must be fixed in Electrical (by 1 player)
    - Comms
      - Players can't view task list
      - Players can't talk
      - Must be fixed in Comms
    - Reactor
      - Game will end in X turns (like 6?)
      - Must be fixed in Reactor - 2 players must fix at the same time
    - Oxygen
      - Game will end in X turns
      - Must be fixed in Oxygen AND Admin
    - Doors
      - "go" actions are interrupted this turn
  

  - Attach a uuid to the client, so they can attempt to reconnect if they lose connection


Extra Stuff:
  - Have a message buffer on client side, allow messages to have a delay before displaying
  - Security Cams (how???)
  - Admin table
  - Check for end of game when a player disconnects
  - Multiple imposters
  - Add "costumes"
  - Allow having multiple imposters
  - Add game settings, like kill cooldown etc
  - Let ghosts do things without needing to lock in
  - Randomized kill messages
  - fake tasks for imposters
  - Show who has an action locked in
  - Autocomplete actions & syntax highlight as you type to show if the action is free or not
  - Fix disconnect issue where the player is not removed from the game
 
  - Have a 'lobby' room in the map with no exits - simplify/streamline the lobby system, allows for lookCommand etc
