Todo:
 - Change to use classes for users and games
 - use a client-stored uuid to ensure users can reconnect if they lose connection
 - change over to use the game uuid as the socket's room id
 - let game.js handle the sockets directly instead of passing messages back to index.js (same with users.js?)
 - store socket in user object
 - add functionality to user object to build a list of messages, and "flush" them to the user
 - add function to take a string and change it to "you" pronouns instead of your name/color
 - Maybe show your image on right side, like a messaging app
 - prevent players from using colors as their username
