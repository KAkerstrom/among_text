Todo:
 - use a client-stored uuid to ensure users can reconnect if they lose connection


Must-haves:
  - Check at start if there are enough players

  - Tasks
    - Once all tasks are complete, the game ends - show Victory/Defeat

  - Sabotage
    - Lights
      - Hides who is in the room, won't show bodies, won't show when imposter vents or kills
      - Must be fixed in Electrical (by 1 player)
    - Comms
      - Players can't view task list
      - Players can't talk
      - Must be fixed in Comms
    - Reactor
      - Game will end in X turns (like 6?)
      - Must be fixed in Reactor - 2 players must fix at the same time
    - Oxygen
      - Game will end in X turns
      - Must be fixed in Oxygen AND Admin
    - Doors
      - "go" actions are interrupted this turn
  

  - Attach a uuid to the client, so they can attempt to reconnect if they lose connection

  - Let ghosts do things without needing to lock in
  - Randomized kill messages
